# 👋 Hey there! I'm Fabio Marcellus  

**Full Stack Software Engineer | Open-Source Enthusiast**

## 🏗️ What I'm Building  

### [**Prompture**](https://github.com/fabiomarcellusdev/prompture)
A CLI tool for efficient AI-assisted development. Prompture helps you maintain context and documentation while working with AI assistants. <br><br>


### [**KoyaLite**](https://github.com/koyalite/koyalite)
KoyaLite is a lightweight, open-source backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platform built around [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/). Designed for indie developers, solo founders, and small teams who want a fast, self-hostable backend without the complexity of cloud-native infrastructure.

I love open-source and believe in **knowledge sharing**. Check out my projects and contributions [here](https://github.com/fabiomarcellusdev?tab=repositories). Contributions, feedback, and collaborations are always welcome!  



## 💡 Fun Facts    
💡 **Love for automation**—if I do something twice, I find a way to automate it.  

🎨 **Design-oriented developer**—I care about **both** aesthetics & performance.  

🎬 **Movie & TV Buff**– I love diving into well-crafted stories, whether it’s sci-fi, deep psychological thrillers, or character-driven dramas. Ask me about my favorite directors or series!
