## Hi there 👋

# 👋 Hey there! I'm Fabio Marcellus  

🚀 **Full Stack Developer | Open-Source Enthusiast**  

I'm passionate about building **ethical, high-quality, and transparent** tech solutions that help people. My work spans across **full-stack development, DevOps, AI integration, and microservices**, with a strong focus on React, Next.js, Express, and scalable backend systems**.

## 🏗️ What I'm Building  


### 📝 **Developer Blog** (WIP - Coming Soon!)  
- **Tech Stack**: Next.js (frontend) & Express (backend)
- **Hybrid Database Architecture**: PostgreSQL (authentication, structured data) & MongoDB (blog posts, comments, analytics)
- **OAuth authentication** (Google, GitHub, etc.) for regular users
- **Microservice Architecture**:
  - API Gateway (REST & GraphQL)
  - Full-text search (ElasticSearch)
  - Event-driven architecture with Kafka/RabbitMQ for notifications & analytics
  - Redis for caching & improving API performance
- **AI-Enhanced Features**:
  - AI-powered blog writing assistant (suggests improvements, refines content)
  - AI-based search & recommendations (personalized reading suggestions)
- **Interactive Features for Developers**:
  - Live Code Editor (Run code snippets in-browser)
  - API Playground (Test API endpoints interactively)
  - Deep Technical Dive Sections (tech stack breakdown, tech decisions and trade-offs, performance benchmarks, best practices)
- **Performance & Security Enhancements**:
  - Next.js ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) & CDN caching
  - WebAuthn (Biometric Authentication) for admin login security
  - Docker & Kubernetes for containerized deployment
  - Prometheus + Grafana for real-time monitoring
- **Engagement & Growth**:
  - Upvote & Bookmark System
  - Newsletter automation (weekly digest powered by Mailgun)
- **Auto-Posting to Social Media**
  - Whenever a new blog post is published, it is automatically shared on Twitter and LinkedIn.
  - Method Choices:
    - Zapier: No-code automation that detects new blog posts and shares them.
    - n8n: Self-hosted open-source automation for greater flexibility.
    - Custom Webhooks + API: Uses Twitter & LinkedIn APIs to auto-post blog updates with a link and hashtags.

### 👨‍💻 **Developer Portfolio** 
- **Tech Stack**: Next.js (frontend) & Express (backend)
- **Work Experience**: A timeline-based showcase of my employers, job roles, responsibilities, and key achievements at each position.
- **Projects Showcase**:
  - Personal Projects: Each project includes a summary, live demo (if available), GitHub link, and a deep-dive blog post explaining technical decisions.
  - Planned, In-Progress, and Completed Projects: A Kanban-style board linking to relevant developer blog articles.
- **Blog Integration**:
  - Fetches and displays latest blog posts via a REST API.
  - Shows total number of posts written.
- **GitHub Activity Feed**: Displays my most recent commits and repository activity.
- **Contact Form**: Includes Google reCAPTCHA for spam protection.
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Theme toggle for a better user experience.
- **Performance-Optimized**:
  - Edge-cached API calls for blog and GitHub data.
  - Lazy-loaded images for fast loading times.
- **AI-powered Chatbot**: Helps visitors explore my projects, experience, and technical insights dynamically.
- **Live Code Demos & Sandbox**: Showcases interactive, runnable code snippets from my projects.
- **Job Match Analyzer**: Allows recruiters to paste a job description and see how my skills align, using AI-powered analysis.
- **Tech Stack Insights**: Displays my most frequently used languages, frameworks, and tools, dynamically updated based on my GitHub activity.
- **Open-Source Leaderboard**: Highlights my most valuable contributions to open-source projects.


### 🛠️ **Pristine Code CLI Tool**
